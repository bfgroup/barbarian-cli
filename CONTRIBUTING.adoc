= Contributing

This is a command line program that manages creating and publishing Conan
packages to the Barbarian server. We welcome all reasonable submissions
to improve this program.

== Discussion

Before diving in and contributing it's expected that you discuss your
proposed changes in our general Barbarian repository
https://github.com/bfgroup/barbarian/discussions[forums]. And if
applicable, refer to any such discussions in your pull request.

== Requirements

When submitting changes please check the following requirements. Making
sure you follow them helps us consider your changes quicker.

=== License

We use the Boost Software License Version 1.0. Which means that:

* If you add a new file it must include a copyright and license statement
  (either at the top or bottom of the file).
  Use this text as a template (where `YYYY` is the current year):
```
Copyright YYYY Your Full Name
Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.
(See accompanying file LICENSE.txt or http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)
```

* If it's a substantial addition to an existing file add a copyright

=== History

Communicating to others the core changes is important to users. With your
change make sure to add to the release notes in the `HISTORY.adoc` file.

=== Code Style

This repository include and `.editorconfig` file that includes preferred
basic code style rules we follow. Please use an editor that uses those
https://EditorConfig.org[EditorConfig] settings. For the Python code use
`autopep8` to apply formatting.

=== Documentation

The main documentation for the CLI exists in the barbarian-server. And
hence we don't expect corresponding documentation. We do appreciate
documentation that explains what your change is doing. I.e. we like
seeing documented code. And we especially love pull requests that just
add documentation.

== Testing

We currently do not have unit tests for the CLI program. And hence don't expect
additions to contain tests. But we do expect for you to have tested your
changes on your own. We also do have a repository of Conan packages
specifically for helping test use cases
(https://github.com/bfgroup/barbarian-test).
